## Problem

### Most Expensive Items

Chef is given the prices of $N$ items and wants to buy exactly $K$ of them.

Find the  **maximum possible total price**  of the $K$ items he can choose.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$ — the number of items and the number of items Chef wants to buy.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_N$ — the prices of the items.
### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer — the total cost of the $K$ most expensive items.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le K \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le C_i \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
5 2
4 9 1 7 6
4 3
10 3 8 5
6 1
2 11 4 9 7 5
```

```
16
23
11
```

### Explanation:

For the first test case, the two highest prices are $9$ and $7$.

$9+7=16$

For the second test case, the three highest prices are $10$, $8$, and $5$.

$10+8+5=23$

For the third test case, Chef buys only the most expensive item, which costs $11$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int Test;
	cin >> Test;
	
	while(Test--){
	     int N, K;
	     cin >> N >> K;
	     vector<int> Arr(N);
	     
	     for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) cin >> Arr[i];
	     
	     sort(Arr.rbegin(), Arr.rend());
	     int Val = 0;
	     
	     for(int i = 0 ; i < K ; i++) Val += Arr[i];
	     
	     cout << Val << endl;
	}

}

```
